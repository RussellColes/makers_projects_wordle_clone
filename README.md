Following 7 working days learning Kotlin and using the Android Studio IDE for the first time, I worked with a colleague to develop a clone of the Wordle game as an app. 
This app was created in just 2 working days. 

## Review of the project ##
We were very pleased with the final result which functions and has a repository of over 500 words to draw from. As always, there are features we would like to improve and extra functionality we would like to put in. The look of the app is a little infantile and we need to improve this to make it more suitable for an adult audience.
Having written the code and created the app, hindsight has taught us a valuable lesson about setting up the ViewModel and using state hoisting. We would have liked to have refactored the app to include these features, but ran out of time. We would also like to include testing which was missed out from this very quick app build - not ideal, we were aware!
